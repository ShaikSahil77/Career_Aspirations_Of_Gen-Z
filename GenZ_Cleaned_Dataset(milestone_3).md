### I'm excited to share another step forward in my KultureHire Data Analyst Virtual Internship! This milestone focused on the critical task of data standardization and preparation, which are foundational skills in the data analysis process. 

## Why This Matters:
### Data is only as good as its quality, and ensuring that it's clean, consistent, and well-organized is key to deriving accurate insights. This task involved:
#### Standardizing Column Headers:
Ensuring clarity and consistency across the entire dataset.
#### Data Standardization:
Each row was standardized to maintain uniformity and accuracy.
#### Handling Null Cells:
Thoughtfully filled null cells with "0" for numeric fields and "N/A" for text fields, preserving data integrity.
#### Formatting the Data: 
Organized the data by splitting it into rows, readying it for deeper analysis.
#### No Data Deletion: 
Adhered to best practices by retaining all columns and data points.
